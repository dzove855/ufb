# UFB (User Friendly Bash) : Bash simple cli framework (Still under construction!)
The idea is to make bash more userfriendly an sharing lib's between multiple  scripts instead of copy/paste or manual sourcing.

# How to 
1. Download the repository and put bin/ufb.sh inside anywhere in $PATH
2. cp libs/* inside /usr/share/ufb
3. Create a new shelscript and as shebang use the ufb.sh
4. That's pretty all, now you can simply import libs's etc.. 
  
# IDEA
MAke more libs and a whole documentation of core libs.
